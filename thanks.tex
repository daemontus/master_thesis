		This work was supported by the Masaryk University as part of the MUNI/C/1017/2015 project: "Automatizovaná syntéza parametrov z temporálnych špecifikácií".
		
	   Personally, I would like to thank all members of the Systems Biology Laboratory for their insights, support and work we all invested in Pithya, \acs{HUCTLp} and other related tools and algorithms. Namely, I would like to thank prof. RNDr. Luboš Brim, CSc., RNDr. David Šafránek, Ph.D., RNDr. Nikola Beneš, Ph.D., Mgr. Martin Demko and Mgr. Matej Hajnal for their time and dedication.
	   
	   I also have to thank my family and friends, who supported me throughout the last five years of my studies and without whom I would not be the person I am today.
