    In order to study complex phenomena arising in nature, one often uses various modelling frameworks which employ parameters to describe the uncertainty of the physical world. Related to these modelling techniques is the problem of parameter synthesis, that is to compute for a desired property the parameter valuations under which the property is satisfied in the model.
    
    In this work, we present a novel parallel algorithm for solving the parameter synthesis problem for properties defined using the \acf{HUCTLp}. The algorithm is based on a semi-symbolic approach, where the state space is represented explicitly while the parameter space is represented symbolically using formulas of a first order logic. The decisions about the parameter space are then delegated to an appropriate solver. The algorithm is implemented as a part of the parameter synthesis tool Pithya.
    
    We show the scalability and applicability of our approach on a set of biochemical models based on ordinary differential equations.
